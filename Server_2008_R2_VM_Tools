The bundled VM tools with VM Workstation version 16X no longer support Server 2008 and fail during installation.

Server 2008 R2 is end of life, and as such VM have stopped supporting it, I still use Server 2008 in my lab’s as it is still commonly used in the wild.

The following is a work round, and for lab use only, it results in an older VM tools been installed.

Spin up a copy of server 2008 R2 then enable admin accounts access to browse the internet.

1. Search for Server Manager / click on it to open

2. On the default Server Manger load page pull down and look for “Configure IE ESC” it’s to the right column under “Security Information” settings / click on it.

3. Under Administrators click off the setting to off / click OK.

You should then be able to browse to https://packages.vmware.com/tools/releases/ and download an older VM manger which supports Server 2008 R2.

Version used in my lab https://packages.vmware.com/tools/releases/10.3.5/windows/x64/VMware-tools-10.3.5-10430147-x86_64.exe

4. Download VMware-tools-10.3.5-10430147-x86_64.exe, right click on it and run as admin, this should then install VM tools on your Server 2008 R2.
